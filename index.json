In simulated experiments, we show that our method is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning, and we analyze why and when it manages to do so.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning,","State Representation Learning"],"title":"Unsupervised learning of state representations for multiple tasks","type":"publication"}]

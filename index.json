Approaches used for this objective are auto-encoders, learning forward models, inverse dynamics or learning using generic priors on the state characteristics. However, the diversity in applications and methods makes the field lack standard evaluation datasets, metrics and tasks. This paper provides a set of environments, data generators, robotic control tasks, metrics and tools to facilitate iterative state representation learning and evaluation in reinforcement learning settings.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","State Representation Learning"],"title":"S-RL Toolbox: Environments, Datasets and Evaluation Metrics for State Representation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Atsushi Sakai","Daniel Ingram","Joseph Dinius","Karan Chawla","Antonin Raffin","Alexis Paques"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535666400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535666400,"objectID":"aec5bbd3e0f2e13f1fa31a26c6bd55dc","permalink":"/publication/python-robotics/","publishdate":"2018-08-31T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/python-robotics/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes an Open Source Software (OSS) project: PythonRobotics. This is a collection of robotics algorithms implemented in the Python programming language. The focus of the project is on autonomous navigation, and the goal is for beginners in robotics to understand the basic ideas behind each algorithm. In this project, the algorithms which are practical and widely used in both academia and industry are selected. Each sample code is written in Python3 and only depends on some standard modules for readability and ease of use. Each algorithm is written in Python3 and only depends on some common modules for readability, portability and ease of use.

Our method learns multiple low-dimensional state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised fashion, without any knowledge of which task is executed, nor of the number of tasks involved. The method is based on a gated neural network architecture, trained with an extension of the learning with robotic priors objective. In simulated experiments, we show that our method is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning, and we analyze why and when it manages to do so.","tags":["State Representation Learning","Reinforcement Learning"],"title":"Unsupervised learning of state representations for multiple tasks","type":"publication"}]
